## 🧩 Introduction

**Custom Link** enables anyone to generate custom short URLs under their own domain — for example:

```
https://urlz.site/event-register
```

This helps make links more readable and shareable while maintaining control over your brand or domain.

The tool includes a **responsive modern UI**, real-time **slug validation**, a **history tracker**, and animated visual effects using **Vanta.js**.  
It is completely front-end driven, making it deployable on **GitHub Pages** or any static hosting service.

## 🛠️ Configuration

**index.html:**
- Customize theme colors in the `:root` CSS variables section.  
- Modify `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_BASE` to point to your own domain.  
- Update schema.org metadata for SEO (website title, description, etc.).  

**404.html:**
- Handles all redirects automatically.
- Fetches `links.json` dynamically to resolve custom short links.

## 🔁 How Redirection Works

1. When someone visits a short link like  
   ```
   https://urlz.site/my-product
   ```
2. The `404.html` script captures the path (`/my-product`).
3. It fetches a live JSON file (`links.json`) maintained by Google Apps Script.
4. If found, the user is redirected instantly to the corresponding long URL.
5. If not, a friendly error message appears with a link to return to the main page.
